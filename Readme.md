# File Searching Program in Java
This is a program written in pure Java language. I used Swing compopents like JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, etc. for designing the GUI side.

## Getting Started
Download the project and open it in Eclipe. Any version of Eclipse should be compatible but it is advised to use Neon
