# File Searching Program in Java
This is a program written in pure Java language. I used Swing compopents like JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, etc. for designing the GUI side.

## Getting Started
Download the project and open it in Eclipe. Any version of Eclipse should be compatible but it is advised to use Neon

## Installing
Make sure u install WindowsBuilder Tools in Eclipse. This will let you play with the GUI part and visualize your GUI. 
Here is the link to download [WindowsBuilder Pro] (http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php). 
After installation, to open GUI Interface, right click on any .java file >> Open With >> WindowsBuiler Editor

## Prerequisites
Make an **empty txt file in C:/ drive**. This will save the theme for the gui. If you want to change the path, then **edit the line number 32** in **FinalProject.java** file to your desired location.

To change the location where u want to search, like if u want to search in D drive rather then C drive, the **edit the line number 307** in **FinalProject.java** file to your desired location.
